\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we presented the first formalization of a hybrid system model of the human heart and the \ac{ICD} device and showed that the resulting closed-loop may be formally verified. 
We showed that the heart model, the \ac{ICD} measurement process, the modules of common \ac{ICD}, and the parallel composition of the entire system to be a STORMED hybrid system, which admits finite bisimulation.
In the process, we were able to show that approximate reachability yields finite simulation for STORMED systems and that certain composition respect the STORMED property.
Finally, we showed that the reach set computed by SpaceEx may be used to build the simulation.
