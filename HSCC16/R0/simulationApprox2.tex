\section{Finite simulation for STORMED systems}
\label{sec:simulationAprox}
In general it is not possible to compute the reach sets required in Alg.~\ref{algo:bisimulation} exactly unless the underlying o-minimal theory is decidable.
The $\Sys_{ICD}||\Sys_{CA}$ closed loop is definable in $\Lc_{\exp}$, and the latter is not known to be decidable.\\
The authors in \cite{PrabhakarVVD09_toklerant} proposed approximating the flows and resets by polynomial flows and resets in the decidable theory $\Lc_\Re$.
However, the approximation process is typically iterative and requires manual intervention, or is restricted to subclasses of STORMED systems \cite{PrabhakarVVD09_toklerant}.
%Even if the o-minimal theory is decidable, the decision procedure first applies Quantifier Elimination, whose worst-case time complexity is doubly exponential in the number of quantifier blocks \cite{DavenportH88_QE}.
%%Whether the bisimulations of STORMED systems can be computed depends on whether the underlying o-minimal theory is decidable. 
%More generally, building the abstraction might require explicit knowledge of the flows (solutions of the ODEs), which is often not possible.
%Collocation methods are more automatic and work with the ODEs directly, but they are restricted to sub-classes of STORMED systems and might still require manual intervention \cite{PrabhakarVVD09_toklerant}.

Here we show that if an approximate reachability tool with definable over-approximations is available for the continuous dynamics, it can be used in Algo~\ref{algo:bisimulation} (instead of exact reachability) to yield a finite simulation (rather than a bisimulation).
Intuitively, the additional intersections of approximate reach sets with blocks of $Q/\sim$ do not destroy finiteness of the procedure.
Since we only have a simulation, counter-examples on the abstraction should be validated in a CEGAR-like fashion.
%Using approximate reachability on a system $\Sys$ is tantamount to replacing $\Sys$ with a system $\Sys^\varepsilon$ whose flows and reset maps are set-valued $\varepsilon$ over-approximations of the flows and resets of $\Sys$ (but is otherwise unchanged).
%
%This is in the spirit of tolerant systems \cite{PrabhakarVVD09_toklerant}, but does not need explicit approximation of the flows.
%We take as our starting point the operators $\Fd$ and $\Fc$, and simply replace the exact $\Ft$ operator by an approximate operator $\Ft^\epsilon$ based on approximate reachability $\Rc^\epsilon_I$, as shown in the following Algorithm \ref{algo:apx Ft}.
%\begin{algorithm}
%	\caption{Simulation refinement for continuous transitions}
%	\label{algo:apx Ft}
%	\begin{algorithmic}
%		\Require Hybrid system $\Sys$, interval $I \subset [0,+\infty)$, a partition $\partition$ of $\hsSet$, $\epsilon>0$.
%		\State Set $\simu = \partition$			
%		\While{$\exists P,P' \in \simu$ s.t. $\emptyset \neq P' \cap \Rc^\epsilon_I(P) \cap P' \neq P'$}
%			\State Set $\simu = \simu \setminus \{P'\} \cup \{P' \cap \Rc_I^\epsilon(P) , P' \setminus \Rc_I^\epsilon(P) \}$
%		\EndWhile	
%		\State Return $\simu^\epsilon$
%	\end{algorithmic}
%\end{algorithm}
%It is clear that $\simu^\epsilon$ is a partition that refines $\partition$. 
%\begin{lemma}
%$\simu^\epsilon$ is finite.
%\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:finite simu}
	Let $\SHS = (\Sys,\ldots)$ be a SHS and $\sim$ and equivalence relation on $\stSet$.
	For any mode $\mode$ of $\Sys$, its dynamical sub-system $\Dc$ with state space $X = \Sys.\stSet$ and flow $\theta_\mode $ admits a finite simulation $\simu_\mode$ that respects $\sim$, returned by Alg.~\ref{algo:bisimulation}.
\end{lemma}
The proof is in the Appendix.
Let $\Ft^\epsilon(\partition) \defeq \cap_{\mode}\simu_{\mode \in \modeSet}$ where $\partition = \stSet/\sim$. $\Ft^\varepsilon$ refines all the $\simu_\mode$'s, and it is a finite simulation of $\Sys$ by itself w.r.t. the continuous transition $\trans{\tau}$.
It is clear that $\Ft^\epsilon(\cdot)$ is idempotent: $\Ft^\epsilon(\Ft^\epsilon(\partition)) = \Ft^\epsilon(\partition)$
%We also have:
%\begin{lemma}
%For any partition $\partition$, $\Ft^\epsilon(\partition)$ is a simulation of $\Sys$ by $T_\Sys/\simu^\epsilon$.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%Two states $x,x' \in \stSet$ are related by $\simu^\varepsilon$ iff $q(x) = q(x')$, that is, their flows visit the same sequence of blocks of $\partition$.
%Do they also visit the same sequence of blocks in $\partition_{\simue}$?
%Assume not, and let $B,B' \in \partition_{\simue}$ be the first blocks in which they differ, that it, $\theta(x,t) \in B$ and $\theta(x',t) \in B'$.
%Because $B,B'$ are different blocks, this implies that there exist $y\in B,y' \in B'$ such that $q(y) \neq q(y')$.
%But $x \in B \implies q(x) = q(y)$, and similarly $x' \in B' \implies q(x')=q(y')$, which contradicts $q(x) = q(x')$.
%Therefore the flows of $x$ and $x'$ visit the same sequence of blocks in $\partition_{\simue}$.
%Thus if we re-apply $\Ft^\varepsilon$ to $\simu^\varepsilon$, it will again yield $x$ and $x'$ will again have the same strings and so remain related by $\Ft^\varepsilon()$
%%Idempotency is immediate: Algorithm \ref{algo:apx Ft} terminates only when no further partitioning of any block $P$ is possible. Thus if we re-run it on $\simu^\epsilon$, it will return $\simu^\epsilon$ and the resulting relation $\Ft^\epsilon$ is unchanged.
%
%Let $\simu^\epsilon = \{P_1,\ldots,P_V\}$ be the final refinement of $\partition$ returned by Algorithm \ref{algo:apx Ft}.
%Write $F \defeq \Ft^\epsilon(\partition)$.
%Let $(x,P) \in F$, that is, $x \in P$. 
%Consider a continuous transition $x \trans{\tau} y$ such that $y = \theta(x,t)$.
%Then by definition $y \in \Theta(x,t) \subset P'$ for some $P' \in \simu^\epsilon$. 
%Moreover $P \trans{} P'$ by definition of the transition relation of $T_\Sys/\simu^\epsilon$, so $(y', P') \in F$.
%
%The converse is not necessarily true: if $P \trans{}P'$ then it might be that $P' = \Rc^\epsilon_I(P) \setminus \Rc^0_I(P)$, i.e. $P'$ is purely the result of the over-approximation.
%In this case, it can not be guaranteed that $x \in P$ will evolve into $P'$.
%This is why $\Ft^\epsilon$ is only a simulation.
%\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
	\label{thm:finite simulation}
	Let $\Sys$ be a STORMED hybrid system, 
	and $\partition$ be a finite definable partition of its state space.
	Define 
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:Fte,Fde}
W_0 = \Ft^\epsilon(\partition), \quad \forall i\geq 0, W_{i+1} = \Ft^\epsilon(\Fd(W_i))
	\end{equation}
Then there exists $U \in \Ne$ s.t. $W_{U+1} = W_U$ and $\Ft^\epsilon(W_U)$ is a simulation of $\Sys$ by itself.
\end{thm}

\begin{prf}
By Lemma 10 of \cite{VladimerouPVD08_STORMED} there exists a uniform bound $U$ on the number of discrete transitions of any execution of the STORMED system $\Sys$, so $\Fd(W_k) = W_k$ for all $k\geq U$.
Moreover 
$W_{U+1} = \Ft^\epsilon(\Fc_d(W_U)) = \Ft^\epsilon(W_U)$
and $W_{U+2}= \Ft^\epsilon(\Fc_d(W_{U+1}))= \Ft^\epsilon(\Fc_t(W_U)) = \Ft^\epsilon(W_U) = W_{U+1}$, so the iterations reach a fixed point.
The fact that $\Ft^\epsilon(W_U)$ is a simulation then yields the desired result.
\end{prf}
%
%Let $AP$ be a set of atomic propositions, and let $\formula$ be an LTL formula over $AP$.
%If the initial partition $\partition$ we start with is given by $x \equiv_\partition y$ iff $(x \models p \leftrightarrow y \models p \; \forall p \in AP)$, then the fact that simulation $\Sys^\epsilon$ satisfies $\formula$ implies that the original hybrid system $\Sys$ satisfies it too.
