Ventricular Fibrillation is a disorganized electrical excitation of the heart that results in inadequate blood flow to the body.
It usually ends in death within a minute.
The most common way to treat the symptoms of fibrillation is to implant a medical device, known as an \emph{Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator} (ICD), in the patient's body.
Model-based verification can supply rigorous proofs of safety and efficacy. 
In this paper, we build a hybrid system model of the human heart+ICD closed loop, and show it to be a \yhl{STORMED system, a class of o-minimal hybrid systems that admit finite bisimulations.}
In general, it may not be possible to compute the bisimulation.
We show that approximate reachability can yield a finite \emph{simulation} for STORMED systems, which improves on the existing verification procedure.
In the process, we show that certain compositions respect the STORMED property.
The results of this paper are theoretical \yhl{and motivate the creation of concrete model checking procedures for STORMED systems.}
