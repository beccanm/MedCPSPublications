\section{Arrhythmia detection}
\label{sec:discriminators}
Because a sustained \ac{VT} (or \ac{VF}) can be fatal whereas an \ac{SVT} is usually not fatal, 
\emph{the ICD's main task is to discriminate \ac{VT} from \ac{SVT} and deliver therapy to the former only} \cite{compass}.
%\emph{\ac{VT}} is an example of a tachycardia originating in the ventricles, in which the ventricles spontaneously beat at a very high rate.
%If the \ac{VT} is sustained, or degenerates into \ac{VF}, it can be fatal.
%A tachycardia that originates above the ventricles is referred to as a \emph{\ac{SVT}} and is a diseased but non-fatal condition.
%In what follows, we will refer to sustained \ac{VT} and \ac{VF} together as \ac{VT}.
%\emph{The ICD's main task is to discriminate \ac{VT} from \ac{SVT} and deliver therapy to the former only}.
Most \ac{VT}/\ac{SVT} detection algorithms found in ICDs today are composed of individual \emph{discriminators}. 
A discriminator is a software function whose task is to decide whether the current arrhythmia is \ac{SVT} or \ac{VT}.
No one discriminator can fully distinguish between SVT and VT.
Thus a detection algorithm is often a decision tree built using a number of discriminators \emph{running in parallel}.
We have modeled each discriminator in this detection algorithm as a STORMED hybrid system.
The algorithm itself is then a hybrid system.
\textbf{The ICD system is thus 
$\mathbf{\Sys_{ICD} = \Sys_{Sense}||\Sys_{Detection-Algo}}$ where $\mathbf{\Sys_{Detection-Algo}}$ is the parallel composition of the discriminator systems}.
In what follows, we present two of these discriminators we modeled, which are found in most ICDs and model them as hybrid systems, and prove they are STORMED.
