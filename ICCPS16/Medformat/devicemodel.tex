\subsection{Implementing Device Algorithms} 
\label{sec:device models}
We wrote software that implements the detection algorithms found in Boston Scientific's and Medtronic's devices based on the available literature.
We validated that our implementation of Boston Scientific's algorithm behaves in the same way as the actual device (9/10 branches covered).
