\subsection{Known lacunae in implementation}
\label{sec:discussion}
We did not account for post-shock detection (a phase of detection that follows the delivery of therapy), which was part of the RIGHT results.
We did not implement the Onset discriminator, which is part of the detection algorithms, so the results exclude its effects.
RIGHT included both dual-chamber and single-chamber devices, whereas we only implemented the algorithms for dual-chamber devices.
For the VTC and Wavelet algorithms, the literature did not specify which samples are taken from the electrogram. 
We chose to sample the electrogram uniformly in time, and validated that this gives correct results.
