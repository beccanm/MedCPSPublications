\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We demonstrated how to design and conduct a \acl{MBCT} in support of RIGHT, which was a prospective trial that compared the diagnostic performance of two algorithms used in specific \ac{ICD} models from different manufacturers.
The results showed that under various distributions of the arrhythmias in the synthetic cohort, the PR Logic + Wavelet algorithm reulted in less arrhythmia mis-classification (and by inference inappropriate therapy) than the RHYTHM ID algorithm. 
Our findings are consistent with the results of the actual clinical trial.
By providing early and reproducible tests of the main assumptions of a clinical trial \emph{before trial start}, \acp{MBCT} can increase the chances of trial success.
%In future work, we will perform a more extensive analysis of the effects of device parameter variation on the outcomes of interest, which can be viewed as an \ac{MBCT} in support of the MADIT-RIT trial \cite{maditrit}.
