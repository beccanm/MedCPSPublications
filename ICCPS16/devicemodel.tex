\section{Implementing Device Algorithms} 
\label{sec:device models}
Due to the limited sensing capability of ICDs, device manufacturers have developed different algorithms to identify the electrical events and correctly diagnose the cardiac arrhythmia as being \ac{VT} or \ac{SVT}.
In this paper we implemented the detection algorithm Rhythm ID of Boston Scientific \cite{compass,Ellenbogen11_Pacingbook},% [???Compass, pacingdefibrillation,VTC paper, ICD book, Ellenbogen].
and PRLogic+Wavelet (PRL+W) of Medtronic \cite{Singer,Wavelet}.
%In available literature on the evaluations of device algorithms descriptions of the device algorithms are not detailed enough for full implementation.
%To obtain the detailed implementation we further reviewed clinical execution traces from literature like \cite{Singer} to infer detailed executions of the algorithms. 
We also set up a testing platform to validate our implementations against real ICDs using conformance testing.
